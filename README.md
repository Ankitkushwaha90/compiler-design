## II 
Basic Parsing Techniques: Parsers, Shift reduce parsing, operator precedence parsing, top down 
parsing, predictive parsers Automatic Construction of efficient Parsers: LR parsers, the canonical 
Collection of LR(0) items, constructing SLR parsing tables, constructing Canonical LR parsing tables, 
Constructing LALR parsing tables, using ambiguous grammars, an automatic parser generator, 
implementation of LR parsing tables.
