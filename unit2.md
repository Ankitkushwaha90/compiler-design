# üìò Parsing Techniques in Compiler Design

## 1. What is Parsing?
Parsing is the process of analyzing a sequence of tokens to determine its grammatical structure according to a given grammar.

**Input**: Stream of tokens from the lexical analyzer.  
**Output**: Parse Tree / Syntax Tree

## 2. Types of Parsers
- **Top-Down Parsers** ‚Äì Start from the start symbol and try to reach the input string.
- **Bottom-Up Parsers** ‚Äì Start from the input and try to reach the start symbol.

## üß≠ Basic Parsing Techniques

### A. Shift-Reduce Parsing (Bottom-Up)
Uses a stack to hold grammar symbols.  
Alternates between:
- **Shift**: Push next input symbol onto the stack.
- **Reduce**: Replace stack symbols matching RHS of a production with its LHS.

Handles:
- A handle is a substring matching the RHS of a production and can be reduced.

### B. Operator Precedence Parsing
Handles expressions using precedence relations between operators.

#### Operator Relations:
- **ùëé < ùëè**: ùëé has lower precedence.
- **ùëé = ùëè**: Same precedence, use associativity.
- **ùëé > ùëè**: ùëé has higher precedence.

#### Limitations:
- Only suitable for operator-based expressions (e.g., arithmetic).
- Cannot handle general grammars or ambiguity.

### C. Top-Down Parsing
Builds parse tree from root to leaves.

#### Types:
- **Recursive Descent Parsing**: Manual implementation using recursive functions. Easy to implement but not efficient for all grammars.
- **Predictive Parsing**: A non-recursive version of recursive descent. Uses lookahead to decide which production to use.

#### FIRST and FOLLOW Sets:
- **FIRST(X)**: Set of terminals that begin strings derived from X.
- **FOLLOW(X)**: Set of terminals that can appear immediately to the right of X.

## üîß Automatic Construction of Efficient Parsers

### 1. LR Parsers (Bottom-Up)
**LR = Left-to-right scanning, producing a Rightmost derivation in reverse.**

#### Types:
- **SLR** (Simple LR)
- **LALR** (Look-Ahead LR)
- **Canonical LR**

### 2. Canonical Collection of LR(0) Items
Core step for constructing LR parsing tables.

**LR(0) Item**: A production with a dot (¬∑) showing position in derivation.

Example:

```vbnet
A ‚Üí Œ±¬∑Œ≤  ‚Üí Dot is before Œ≤ (we've seen Œ±)
```
## 3. Constructing SLR Parsing Tables
- Use **LR(0)** items.
- Use **FOLLOW** sets to resolve conflicts in reduce actions.
- More straightforward but may not handle all grammars.

## 4. Constructing Canonical LR Parsing Tables
- Uses **LR(1)** items (dot + lookahead symbol).
- More powerful, handles all deterministic context-free grammars.
- Bigger tables and more states.

## 5. Constructing LALR Parsing Tables
- Combines similar **LR(1)** states to reduce size.
- Same power as **Canonical LR** for most practical grammars.
- Efficient and widely used in parser generators like **YACC**.

## 6. Using Ambiguous Grammars
Some grammars (e.g., for expressions) are ambiguous by nature.

#### Approaches:
- Disambiguate using precedence rules.
- Use associativity (left/right) for operators.

## 7. Automatic Parser Generator
**YACC** (Yet Another Compiler Compiler) is a classic tool.

- Takes BNF grammar as input.
- Generates **LALR** parser in C.

## 8. Implementation of LR Parsing Tables
Two main tables:
- **ACTION Table**: Determines shift, reduce, accept, or error.
- **GOTO Table**: Determines state transition after a reduction.

#### Parsing Algorithm (LR):
1. Initialize stack with state 0.
2. Repeat:
   - Use current state and input symbol to look up **ACTION**.
   - **Shift**: Push state & token.
   - **Reduce**: Pop symbols, apply rule, go to **GOTO** table.
   - **Accept**: Input matches grammar.
